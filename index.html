        <p>Hedy Lamarr was born Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler, an Austrian-born American actress, inventor, and film 
            producer. She appeared in 30 films over a 28-year career in Europe and the United States and co-invented 
            an early version of frequency-hopping spread spectrum communication, originally intended for torpedo guidance.</p>

        <p>Lamarr was born in Vienna, Austria-Hungary, and acted in a number of Austrian, German, and Czech films in her 
            brief early film career, including the controversial Ecstasy. In 1937, she fled from her husband, secretly moving 
            to Paris and then on to London. There, she met Louis B. Mayer, head of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) studio, who offered 
            her a Hollywood movie contract, where he began promoting her as "the world's most beautiful woman".</p>

        <p>She became a star through her performance in Algiers, her first American film. Lamarr co-founded a new production studio 
            and starred in its films, also acted on television, before the release of her final film, The Female Animal. She was 
            honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960.</p>

        <p>At the beginning of World War II, Lamarr and composer George Antheil developed a radio guidance system using frequency-hopping spread spectrum technology for Allied torpedoes, intended to defeat the threat of jamming by the Axis powers. She also helped improve aircraft aerodynamics for Howard Hughes, while they dated during the war.</p>

        <p>Although the US Navy did not adopt Lamarr and Antheil's invention until 1957, various spread-spectrum techniques are incorporated into Bluetooth technology and are similar to methods used in legacy versions of Wi-Fi. Recognition of the value of their work resulted in the pair being posthumously inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2014

        <p>Although Lamarr had no formal training and was primarily self-taught, she worked in her spare time on various hobbies and inventions, which included an improved traffic stoplight and a tablet that would dissolve in water to create a carbonated drink. The beverage was unsuccessful; Lamarr herself said it tasted like Alka-Seltzer.

        <p>Among the few who knew of Lamarr's inventiveness was aviation tycoon Howard Hughes. She suggested he change the rather square design of his airplanes (which she thought looked too slow) to a more streamlined shape, based on pictures of the fastest birds and fish she could find. He put his team of scientists and engineers at her disposal, saying they would do or make anything she asked for.
                Frequency-hopping spread spectrum
                During World War II, Lamarr learned that radio-controlled torpedoes, an emerging technology in naval war, could easily be jammed and set off course. She thought of creating a frequency-hopping signal that could not be tracked or jammed. She conceived an idea and contacted her friend, composer, and pianist George Antheil, to help her implement it.

                Together they developed a device for doing that when he succeeded by synchronizing a miniaturized player-piano mechanism with radio signals. They drafted designs for the frequency-hopping system, which they patented. Their invention was granted a patent under U.S. Patent 2,292,387 on 11 August 1942 (filed using her married name Hedy Kiesler Markey). However, it was technologically difficult to implement, and at the time the US Navy was not receptive to considering inventions coming from outside the military. Before the expiration date, it was adapted firstly in 1957 to develop a sonobuoy, although the Navy denied it. At the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, an updated version of their design was installed on Navy ships.
                
                 Today, various spread-spectrum techniques are incorporated into Bluetooth technology and are similar to methods used in legacy versions of Wi-Fi.[14][15][16] Lamarr and Antheil's contributions were formally recognized in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.
